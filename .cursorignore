# Exclude empty Content subfolders from indexing (they're just placeholder folders)
# Note: If you create Blueprints or other assets you need to search, comment these out
# Content/Developers/

# Temporary & Autosave Files
Saved/Autosaves/
*.tmp
*.temp

# Exclude Unreal Engine Installation (huge, not needed for indexing)
# Note: The UE5 folder is excluded via workspace settings

# IMPORTANT: Keep these indexed for AI context (source code, configs, project files):
# Source/ files are ALWAYS accessible - I can read them on demand
# Config/ files are accessible when needed
# *.uproject and *.code-workspace are accessible

# Note: The AI (Cursor) can read files explicitly when you ask questions,
# so even if something isn't "indexed", I can still access it when needed.
# Indexing mainly helps with search and quick context.
